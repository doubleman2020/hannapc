Hackintosh based on ASUS ROG STRIX Z390-E GAMING motherboard and AMD GPU on OpenCore EFIs...

Based on the https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html

In EFIs folder, you have two folders with OpenCore 0.5.9 stuff and configurations to re-use:

RUN: RunTime EFI for the regular usge you may ZIP it and store on you install-safe pen-drive

INS: Install EFI for the install-safe pen-drive in case of any messed up on the RUN rollback

Look in config.plist change all "CHANGE_ME!" values into proper and expected "SECRET" values.

Enjoy!
